As we witness staggering rates of global biodiversity loss, environmental and wildlife protection has never been more important in safeguarding the future health of our planet.

Our mission is to Fight, Protect, and Engage on behalf of endangered wildlife around the world.

Our ground-based conservation partners, operating on the front line in the fight against wildlife crime, are protecting some of the worldâ€™s last wildlife strongholds and pristine wilderness landscapes. As the climate catastrophe escalates, pressure on these dwindling wildlife populations and locations grows. DSWF is at the heart of enabling and ensuring wildlife is given the fighting chance it needs to stabilise and recover.

By investing in economically and socially vulnerable communities at the heart of the conservation landscape we support programmes that have a real impact, on real people, in real places as we fight to turn the tide on extinction.

Ensuring our artistic heritage lives on in memory of our Founder, the celebrated wildlife artist and conservationist, David Shepherd, we continue to reach, inspire, and engage people to join our fight to save wildlife.
